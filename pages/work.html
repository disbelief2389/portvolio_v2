        <h1>Work</h1>
        <p>
            Today I'm going to be making a fighter game in JavaScript, following a tutorial to better understand the language and to familiarise myself with it. I'm thinking I'll just make the game straight in the portfolio as opposed to making it in its own dedicated folder. There's not much different really, as I would just be nesting it anyway if I imported it.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, enough chat, let's get to it!</p>
        <p>You can play the game <a href="/pages/fighter-game/index.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p><span class="italic">Note: this game is optimised for desktop users only</span></p>
