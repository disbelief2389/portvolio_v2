        <p>
            There was a young man named Blake who lived in Melbourne Victoria, he was 23 years old, his mother left his father when he was 2 and moved to the other side of the world, ever since he has been poisoned with the realisation that his mother is a liar, and sees the only way out to be through his electronic/hip hop music production.
            Blake poured all his pain and anger into his beats, creating music that resonated with the deepest corners of his soul.
            But somehow it wasn't enough to capture the attention of others, which, after thought and recollection came as a revelation that he wasn't digging deep enough.
            Determined to uncover the rawest parts of his emotions, Blake began to reflect on his childhood memories and the pain of his mother's departure.
        </p>
        <p>
            He misses his father, and the truth that has been buried by lies all of his life, without any say in the matter until now, as a tired and exhausted adult.
            Seeking solace and clarity, Blake decides to reconnect with his father to uncover the hidden truths of his past.
            He finds out that the reason his mother left his father is because he witnessed her sexual abuse in the Mormon church, leading to him leaving the mormon church, leading to his mother leaving his father in order to maintain her faithfulness to the oligarchy.
            This shocking revelation left Blake grappling with a whirlwind of emotions as he tried to process the complex and painful family history he had just uncovered.
        </p>
        <p>
            He knew that he needed to leave for a long time, to forge his own path, but the implications, the effort and the turmoil it would require, he did not know if he had it in him.
            Nevertheless, Blake resolved to confront his fears head-on, believing that through embracing his pain and turmoil, he would ultimately find the strength to create his most authentic and powerful music.
            Everyday he woke up at 4am--understanding that no one understood him, and proceeding through to honour himself and through that, all those around him and on the planet--playing self-confidence affirmations on repeat non-stop 24/7, to reprogram his mind.
            With each passing day, Blake felt the affirmations beginning to take root, slowly rebuilding his shattered self-esteem and igniting a fire within him to pursue his dreams relentlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a small but steady voice growing inside of him, he coined the term to help himself along, "people can say what they want, but they can't change your inner monologue."
            With his newfound resolve, Blake started channeling his emotions into his music with even greater intensity, creating beats and lyrics that were raw, real, and unapologetically authentic.
            He knew that from here-on-out, the momentum was unstoppable, the light was too strong, and it was only a matter of time before that which was lost was to be resurrected.
            As Blake's music began to gain recognition and resonate with a wider audience, he felt a sense of redemption and purpose, knowing that his journey of self-discovery and healing was inspiring others as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            But he knew that the recognition wasn't something to get attached to, as the real victory was within, thus, he kept his focus there.
            Despite the growing success, Blake remained grounded, continually reminding himself that his true strength came from within and that his music was a vehicle for his self-healing and personal growth.
            Nonetheless, his mother, a corporate lawyer, still saw him with his unmaintained beard, shaved head and bad heigine as a failure, nevertheless, he saw that as a duty to himself to ignore her opinion.
            Blake stayed true to his path, understanding that his mother's judgment was a reflection of her own insecurities and not a measure of his worth.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a while, Blake remained unemployed, which made it difficult to make the moves he desired.
            However, he remained resilient and resourceful, using his spare time to refine his music skills and explore new creative avenues.
            He secured a volunteering role centered on providing companionship to an elderly person for 6-12 months, and while this may seem like nothing to his mother and her current husband who only valued money over real present value, it was all he needed, a pure and genuine connection with an old soul to trade company and youth for wisdom and knowledge.
            In those quiet moments shared with the elderly soul, Blake found himself listening to stories of the past, absorbing invaluable life lessons that enriched his music and deepened his understanding of human connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            But those moments haven't come yet, as Blake is still in the process of organising this potential relationship.
            As he patiently waited for this new chapter to begin, Blake continued to hone his craft, drawing inspiration from the anticipation of forming a deep, meaningful connection with someone who had lived a long and storied life.
            The despair he holds in his soul to be released from his mother's grip of demonic projection is unspeakable, akin to that of a dream where one's mouth is sealed shut.
            Blake's music became his voice, a powerful outlet where he could express the depth of his anguish and the fierce determination to break free from his mother's hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            And while hours of his music was available to the public, his position was so obscure that when it did not land with the mainstream straight away, he lost confidence in his own work, leading to the connection to delay--nevertheless--he remained confident that one day his own confidence in his own story would be enough to drive him to stand by his story, to be there for himself in rain or shine.
            Despite the setbacks and delayed recognition, Blake's unwavering belief in his story fueled his determination to persevere, knowing that his resilience and authenticity would ultimately shine through.
            He coined the term 'radical authenticity', which was put down by near voices as 'bullshit'--deep down he knew from the get-go that the concept behind the term is what counts, and bullshit is actually the antithesis of what it was which Jordan Peterson labelled such actions online as promoting 'anti-truths', truths which are not only false, but deliberately antithetical from the truth.
            Blake, driven by his commitment to radical authenticity, continued to create music that confronted these anti-truths and revealed the raw, unfiltered reality of his experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though for time it was only for his own ears and no employer that would come across his lousy portfolio would look twice at it, he knew that with help of those of the likes of Kendrick Lamar, who put folks like Drake in their right place, one day maybe it wouldn't take so much effort.
            Undeterred by his current obscurity, Blake continued to hone his craft, drawing inspiration from influential artists and staying true to his radical authenticity, convinced that his moment would come.
            So now, Blake sits at his mother's desk, typing away some 'bullshit', whilst those around him write his ideas off as crazy and in need of mental support, knowing that everyone around him is a snake, knowing that when his money is right, he's gone.
            With every keystroke, Blake's determination grew stronger, fueling his resolve to escape the toxic environment and finally reclaim his life on his own terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            To just be able to wake up in the morning and not feel like you owe everyone around you something, for some reason apparently they themselves don't even know what said reason is--there's just something wrong with you, or something.
            Blake longed for the day when he could break free from the invisible chains of expectation and judgment, finally living a life unburdened by the weight of others' opinions and finding peace within himself.
            He knew that writing and crafting and weaving his creativity through the darkness was his guiding light, and that the power of autosuggestion wasn't written and used over a century ago by Napoleon Hill and many of the greats for no reason, as if Buddha said that with our thoughts we make the world, for no reason--Blake took the words of these mentors of his very literally, and ensured that every quiet moment he could find, he was hearing the uttermost positive thoughts he could get his paws on.
            By immersing himself in these positive affirmations, Blake gradually transformed his mindset, cultivating a relentless determination to overcome his struggles and create a life defined by his own terms and aspirations.
        </p>
        <p>
            He knew that while they might not be the be-all-and-end-all, he also knew that what he was hearing through his earphones, he wasn't hearing anywhere else, and he knew where his main source of energy and confidence was coming from.
            Fueled by this unwavering source of energy, Blake continued to push forward, confident that his journey of self-discovery and personal growth would ultimately lead him to the success and fulfillment he sought.
            Knowing that between the trees, up on a mountain, some place, somewhere, sometime soon, he would go, and meet the wilderness 1 on 1, not with any expectations, but with a knowing that beaurocracy would not dare follow, and the freedom from the poison of the cities would slowly leak from his veins, into the ground, to be digested into something a little more natural.
            In that serene embrace of nature, Blake found a sanctuary where his mind could unravel and his spirit could finally begin to heal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though he did not have the means to go often, whenever he was there, he was home, there was no search, there was no question, no answer, just fresh fucking air, and space from so many people, plaster, concrete, construction, logistics, political correctness, you name it.
            In those precious moments of solitude, Blake felt the weight of the world lift off his shoulders, replaced by a profound sense of peace and clarity.
            He held no grudges for anyone, he had a place to cry, scream, yell, punch, kick, vomit--whatever he needed to do for his soul to find peace--something that was inexplicably absent from city life in it's suffocating, poisonous nature, filled with alcoholic fumes to the neck.
            In the heart of the wilderness, Blake found a sanctuary where he could truly release his pent-up emotions and reconnect with the essence of his being.
        </p>
        <p>
            He found it curious that animals don't care to see him naked, to see who he truly is, in all of his weight and baggage--they continue climbing trees, fetching acorns, pollinating flowers--it has nothing to do with Blake and he loves that.
            In the presence of nature's indifference, Blake found a unique sense of freedom and acceptance, allowing him to embrace his true self without fear of judgment.
            Internally, externally, it didn't matter, he didn't have to talk a certain way, walk a certain way, write a certain way, or make sure not to post this, or make sure not to say that in front of this person or that.


In the embrace of nature, Blake finally felt liberated from societal expectations and judgments, allowing his true essence to flourish without restraint.
        </p>
        <p>
            He felt connected to his ancestors who called to him every day, saying, "Go, my son, you've heard the call, now go!!!"


Blake embraced the ancestral call with a fierce determination, knowing that his journey was about more than just personal healing—it was a profound quest for truth, legacy, and ultimate freedom. His music and personal growth were deeply intertwined with honoring the voices of the past while forging a path for the future.


Blake's journey was one of self-discovery and empowerment, as he navigated the complexities of his past and present, seeking to break free from the chains of expectation and find his own path to success and fulfillment.

Success looks different to everybody, to most it looks like dollar bills, to Blake--dying peacefully is all he wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weight of his family's history and the burden of societal expectations had left him yearning for a simple, quiet release.

To be in the woods and say nothing, eat nothing, do nothing, for weeks on end, to de-condition his hamster-trained-brain into something a little more knowing, a little more aware, a little more steady.

The city's cacophony had dulled his senses, and the forest's quiet hum promised a return to himself.

Like a portal into the past to revitalize that which was lost.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rustling leaves whispered stories of resilience, echoing the strength he sought within himself.

Every day in the mirror was a battle with the world in his head, he just wanted peace, that's all, no wars, just peace.

The reflection stared back, a stranger worn by years of unspoken trauma and the weight of inherited secrets.

Numb to all of it, he knew that the secrets lay in facing the demons, in letting them go into the wind, in a primal scream that is only legal where the law can't find you.
        </p>
        <p>
            The forest's vastness became his confessional, a place where he could unleash the pent-up anguish that had festered for years.

No, father 'I have sinned' bullshit, but a 'father let me be free from this pain, take it from my soul, here, I give it to you, in the most instinctual way possible'.

He imagined his father's weathered hands reaching out, not in judgment, but in a silent, understanding acceptance of the burden he carried.

He wondered what his birth father thought, how he managed the situation, as it had been the longest for him since he saw my mothers' truest colours, that she would be so disloyal as to choose an abusive oligarchy over her own husband.
        </p>
        <p>
            The thought of his father's silent suffering ignited a raw, visceral anger within Blake, a burning need to understand the man who had endured such betrayal.

He felt proud to be a man, feeling a brotherly pact between each of his fathers who had all endured so much, and never given up, not once lost a battle in life, every morning, waking up and punching again.

The resilience of his lineage fueled his own determination, reinforcing the strength he found in their shared experiences.

He pitied his mother, for how sad she was, to never look to the light, not once in all her years since her mothers' passing, and God knows how long before then.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weight of her choices, the chains of her allegiance, painted a portrait of a woman trapped in a self-made prison.

He tried to open the bars, to unlock the cage, to get her out, to stand with her bullshit despite the fact of her ignorance, but even she had pushed him too far, her firstborn son--she ignored his warnings and crossed an uncross-able line, as to which she will be having many 'father I have sinned's to come, you may be sure.

The anger surged, a torrent of betrayal and frustrated love, yet he knew dwelling on it would only perpetuate the cycle of pain.

He moved forward with the spirit of a warrior, relentless and determined with the willpower of a thousand men and the mental fortitude to make the moves necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weight of his past, once a crushing burden, now fueled his resolve, transforming him into a force of unwavering strength.

Though each day he looked in the mirror at a fat, sad man--behind the man that had been shaped before him lie a child, with the heart of a lion, determined to claim his birth-right, at all costs, at any cost.

The child's spirit, buried beneath layers of trauma and societal conditioning, began to resurface, a raw, untamed force ready to reclaim its rightful place.

Each day he felt the layers fall, fall, fall, fall, standing nevertheless, beneath the ashes, now a true man, forged in the fires of hell, come to earth to free humanity from bondage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weight of his lineage, the pain of his past, and the clarity of his purpose coalesced into a singular, unwavering resolve.

Through music, through frequency, through unapologetic defiance, or radical authenticity if you will, he did not care what people thought, he knew what he knew, and as his mother said, it became personal, and as Kendrick said, you picked the right time, but the wrong guy.

The fusion of his music and his newfound self-awareness created a powerful conduit for his message, a raw expression of his truth that resonated with the very core of his being.

Everyday fueled with a fire burning and raging, burning and raging, burning, burning, burn, burn, burn... all he saw was this spiritual fire, that scared others who worshiped fear to death--he saw this worship in their eyes and tolerated it for a time, but knew that his tolerance was temporary, that one day he would make like a tree and leave.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flames of his inner fire reflected in his eyes, a beacon of truth that challenged the complacency of those around him.

Making others uncomfortable, unsteady, unsure of what to do except to attack him for having such energy.

The fear in their eyes fueled his resolve, a testament to the power of his unwavering authenticity.

He returned their frightful gazes with disappointment in their actions, a clear message that they chose complacency over dignity, humanity, love and life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weight of their fear became a mirror reflecting their own internal struggles, a stark contrast to the freedom he had found within himself.

It was spiritual, visceral, impenetrable, in-disposable, inexplicable, undeniable and unwavering, solid, infinite--true.

This truth, forged in the crucible of his pain and revelation, became the bedrock of his existence.

It became his peace of mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chaos of his past and the uncertainty of his future faded into the background, replaced by a profound sense of inner stillness.

This paranoid schizophrenic anxiety that had consumed the world had suddenly fallen from his shoulders, as he fell to be somebody else, someone you wouldn't understand unless you talked to him and he talked to you.

The weight of societal expectations and the suffocating pressure of conformity melted away, leaving behind a raw, unfiltered essence of self.

Something that was so threatening to others, something that was completely disarming to their games.
        </p>
        <p>
            His newfound authenticity became a shield, deflecting the manipulative tactics of those who sought to control him.

This was his lifeline, this was his church, his God, his religion, his soul, his art, his painting, his life, his legacy, his worthiness, his code.

His music, once a vessel for pain, now transformed into a sacred expression of his liberated spirit.

Timeless, the music was a quantum continuum of his soul, available for anyone who cared to listen to the language he spoke--a language not of words, but of the fabric of this reality--frequency and vibration--ask your local quantum physicists if you are uncertain as to the meaning of that statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intricate layers of his compositions became a portal, inviting listeners to transcend the limitations of their own perceptions and explore the depths of their inner worlds.

Venturing into worlds unimaginable, yet somehow, for some reason, divinely intervened into our little portion of the universe.

The echoes of his ancestral call resonated through his music, weaving tales of resilience and liberation that transcended time and space.

With all that, he was quite tired one afternoon of writing, and he felt it was time to rest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weight of his revelations and the intensity of his creative process had finally taken their toll.

His brain was on fire every day, and for years he did not know why, until now, which in ways made things better, in others, not so much.

The weight of his newfound understanding, coupled with the relentless intensity of his creative drive, had left him emotionally and mentally exhausted.

So, he retreated to his bed and fell into a deep sleep

The exhaustion pulled him into a dreamless void, a temporary respite from the relentless churn of his thoughts.
